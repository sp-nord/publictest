There are things that could be done better or differently in the tests.
But you know, first it works then it works pretty. At least that's what I'm trying to reason myself with.
I'd like to know the score though, like 3/10 or something. So, please, evaluate how much junior devops I am.


There is no actual CV, just some background description...

Worked for quite long in university. Started as a system administrator, left as a head of telecom department (it was small actually).
Mostly worked with networks. OS were freebsd, some ubuntu atop of hyper-v and esx. Built networks; softrouters and more on freebsd; monitoring with dude, zabbix, grafana; standard LAMP, LEMP servers.
By the end it was too little actual hands-on work to continue.

Currently I work in a software development company and have a proud title 'SRE'.
The company is quite big, with multiple offices around the world, so there are few aspects I actually cover. I.e. dev and test environments buildout and troubleshooting, AWS activities, scripting and automation.

~9 working years in total.
